The laboratory of Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (Yu Lab) is founded in September 2020 and based in the College of Life Science, Sichuan University (SCU), China.
<br>
At the interface between Biology and Computer Science, the Yu lab seeks a better understanding of species origins and biological evolutionary histories. Mainly based on high-throughput sequencing technologies, we use the statistical and computational methods to detangle the genes and traits.
