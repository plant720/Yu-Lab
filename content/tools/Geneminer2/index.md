GeneMiner2 is a comprehensive toolkit designed for phylogenomic genomics. Its main functionalities include:

* Mining single-copy nuclear genes, plastid genes/genomes, and other molecular markers from next-generation sequencing data.
* Aligning and trimming multiple molecular markers, constructing concatenated and coalescent-based phylogenetic trees, and calibrating tree time.
* Identifying paralogs/multicopy genes.

Users can complete all tasks from obtaining NGS data to establishing phylogenetic trees within GeneMiner2.
