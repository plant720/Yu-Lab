NetST is an integrated software designed to handle increasingly large and complex haplotype datasets with multiple traits in the genomics era. It enables users to efficiently calculate haplotype sequences, construct haplotype networks, visualize networks, and conduct comprehensive haplotype network analytics.

NetST implements core functionalities for haplotype network construction and visualization with a complete upstream and downstream analysis pipeline, significantly improving research efficiency. The software features innovative Quantitative Topological Analytics for network topology analysis, helping researchers better identify main groups, key hubs, and critical edges within networks.

Additionally, NetST provides dual-trait mapping and correlation analysis capabilities, allowing simultaneous visualization of associated traits within a single haplotype network and performing statistical correlation analysis on related traits, offering a more comprehensive perspective for phylogenetic relationship analysis.
