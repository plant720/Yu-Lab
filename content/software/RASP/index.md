title: RASP (Reconstruct Ancestral State in Phylogenies)

summary: A tool for inferring ancestral state.
introduction: RASP (Reconstruct Ancestral State in Phylogenies) is a tool for inferring ancestral state using S-DIVA (Statistical dispersal-vicariance analysis), Lagrange (DEC), Bayes-Lagrange (S-DEC), BayArea, BBM (Bayesian Binary MCMC) method, Bayestraits and BioGeoBEARS packages.
