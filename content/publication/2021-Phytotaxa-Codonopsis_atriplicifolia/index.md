abstract: |
  *Codonopsis atriplicifolia* (Campanulaceae) from western Sichuan, China, is described here as a new species, which is similar to *C. subscaposa* in a number of characters. The results of molecular phylogenetic analysis of 25 species of *Codonopsis* based on chloroplast DNA fragments (matK, petD with petB-petD, rbcL) show that *C. atriplicifolia* is closely related to *C. farreri*. In morphology, the new species is distinctly different from the allied species by its linear-lanceolate leaves with subentire to pinnatipartite margins.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'Description of *Codonopsis atriplicifolia*, a new species from western Sichuan, China, supported by molecular phylogenetic analysis and distinct morphological characters.'
