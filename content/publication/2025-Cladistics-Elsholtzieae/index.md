abstract: The angiosperm tribe of Elsholtzieae (Lamiaceae) is characterized by complex inflorescences and has notable medicinal and economic significance. Relationships within Elsholtzieae, including the monophyly of *Elsholtzia* and *Keiskea*, and relationships among *Mosla*, *Keiskea* and *Perilla*, remain uncertain, hindering insights into inflorescence evolution within the tribe. Using hybridization capture sequencing and deep genome skimming data analysis, we reconstruct a phylogeny of Elsholtzieae using 279 orthologous nuclear loci from 56 species. We evaluated uncertainty among relationships using concatenation, coalescent and network approaches. Using a time-calibrated phylogeny, we reconstructed ancestral inflorescence traits to elucidate the patterns in their evolution within the tribe. Our analyses consistently support the paraphyly of the genus *Elsholtzia*. Phylogenetic network analyses confirmed complex evolutionary relationships within this taxonomically challenging group.

This study represents a significant advancement in understanding the evolutionary relationships within Elsholtzieae, a medically and economically important tribe of the mint family (Lamiaceae). By employing cutting-edge phylogenomic approaches with 279 orthologous nuclear genes, we provide the most comprehensive phylogenetic framework to date for this taxonomically challenging group.
