  **Background**:
  *Scutellaria*, a sub-cosmopolitan genus, stands as one of the Lamiaceae family's largest genera, encompassing approximately 500 species found in both temperate and tropical montane regions. Recognized for its significant medicinal properties, this genus has garnered attention as a research focus, showcasing anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and hepatoprotective qualities. Additionally, it finds application in agriculture and horticulture. Comprehending *Scutellaria*'s taxonomy is pivotal for its effective utilization and conservation. However, the current taxonomic frameworks, primarily based on morphological characteristics, are inadequate. Despite several phylogenetic studies, the species relationships and delimitations remain ambiguous, leaving the genus without a stable and reliable classification system.

  **Results**:
  This study analyzed 234 complete chloroplast genomes, comprising 220 new and 14 previously published sequences across 206 species, subspecies, and varieties worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using six data matrices through Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference, resulting in a robustly supported phylogenetic framework for *Scutellaria*. We propose three subgenera, recommending the elevation of Section Anaspis to subgeneric rank and the merging of Sections Lupulinaria and Apeltanthus. The circumscription of Subgenus Apeltanthus and Section Perilomia needs to be reconsidered. Comparative analysis of chloroplast genomes highlighted the IR/SC boundary feature as a significant taxonomic indicator. We identified a total of 758 SSRs, 558 longer repetitive sequences, and ten highly variable regions, including trnK–rps16, trnC–petN, petN–psbM, accD–psaI, petA–psbJ, rpl32–trnL, ccsA–ndhD, rps15–ycf1, ndhF, and ycf1. These findings serve as valuable references for future research on species identification, phylogeny, and population genetics.

  **Conclusion**:
  The phylogeny of *Scutellaria*, based on the most comprehensive sample collection to date and complete chloroplast genome analysis, has significantly enhanced our understanding of its infrageneric relationships. The extensive examination of chloroplast genome characteristics establishes a solid foundation for the future development and utilization of *Scutellaria*, an important medicinal plant globally.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'A comprehensive phylogenomic study of *Scutellaria* using 234 chloroplast genomes (220 newly sequenced), providing the most robust evolutionary framework for this medically important genus.'
