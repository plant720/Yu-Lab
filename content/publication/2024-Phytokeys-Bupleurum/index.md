abstract: '*Bupleurum*, belonging to the Apiaceae, is widely distributed across the Eurasian continent. The origin and species diversification of *Bupleurum* in East Asia remain incompletely resolved due to limited samples in previous studies. To address these issues, we have reconstructed a robust phylogenetic framework for *Bupleurum* in East Asia based on the ITS and three plastid genes. Our phylogenetic analysis confirms the monophyly of *Bupleurum* with strong support. Both ITS and chloroplast datasets divided the *Bupleurum* in East Asia into East Asia Group I and East Asia Group II in this study. The divergence time and ancestral area reconstruction of ITS dataset indicated that *Bupleurum* originated in the Mediterranean basin and its adjacent areas around 50.33 Ma. Subg. *Penninervia* and subg. *Bupleurum* diverged at about 44.35 Ma, which may be related to the collision of India with the Eurasian continent. Our results provide new insights into the biogeographic history and evolutionary patterns of this economically important genus.'

This study provides important insights into the evolutionary history and biogeographic patterns of *Bupleurum*, a medicinally and economically significant genus in the carrot family (Apiaceae). By employing both nuclear (ITS) and plastid molecular markers, we have reconstructed the most comprehensive phylogenetic framework for East Asian *Bupleurum* to date.
