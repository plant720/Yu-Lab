  abstract = {Bupleurum, belonging to the Apiaceae, is widely distributed across the Eurasian continent. The origin and species diversification of Bupleurum in East Asia, remain incompletely resolved due to the limited samples in previous studies. To address these issues, we have reconstructed a robust phylogenetic framework for Bupleurum in East Asia based on the ITS and three plastid genes. Our phylogenetic analysis confirms the monophyly of Bupleurum with strong support. Both ITS and chloroplast dataset divided the Bupleurum in East Asia into East Asia Group I and East Asia Group II in this study. The divergence time and ancestral area reconstruction of ITS dataset indicated that the Bupleurum originated in the Mediterranean basin and its adjacent areas around 50.33 Ma. subg. Penninervia and subg. Bupleurum diverged at about 44.35 Ma, which may be related to the collision of India with the Eurasian continent. Both East Asia Group I and East Asia Group II originated from a common ancestor in the Mediterranean, East Asia Group I divergence around 12.95 Ma; East Asia Group II divergence around 13.32 Ma. The character reconstruction showed that the morphological characters and altitude distribution analyzed in this study exhibit a scattered distribution in East Asian Group I and East Asian Group II. Additionally, diversification rate analysis shows that the East Asian Group I and East Asian Group II exhibited no significant shifts in diversification rates in the evolutionary history according to ITS and combined dataset. Both molecular and morphological data supports that East Asian Bupleurum is a museum taxon, meaning that the species diversity of East Asian Bupleurum has gradually accumulated over time.},
