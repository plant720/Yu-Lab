abstract: Due to the high cost of whole-genome sequencing and the sampling difficulty of transcriptome sequencing in non-model plants, evolutionary studies often depend on next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Nonetheless, current approaches typically focus on assembling chloroplast genomes or a few nuclear loci, leaving much of the genomic information from NGS underexploited. In this study, we employed multigenomic data sets and advanced analytical pipelines to reconstruct a robust phylogenetic framework for 39 *Bupleurum* species. Nuclear gene data sets and organellar genomes derived from NGS were analyzed. We successfully reconstructed a robust phylogenetic framework for East Asia (EA) *Bupleurum*, in which two clades were strongly supported and all intersectional relationships were resolved. Phylogenetic discordance was mainly caused by incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization. Divergence dating analysis revealed important evolutionary patterns and distribution insights for this economically and medicinally important plant genus.
