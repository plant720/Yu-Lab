  abstract = {The tribe Potentilleae comprises approximately 1700 species in 13 genera, making it one of the largest of the 16 tribes in Rosaceae. Our understanding of the composition and relationships among members of Potentilleae has advanced dramatically with the application of molecular markers in the last two decades. Yet there is still much work remaining toward a robust phylogenetic framework for the entire Potentilleae and a comprehensive genus-level dating framework for the tribe. The goals of the present study were to establish a phylogenetic framework for Potentilleae, infer the origin and diversification of the tribe using a temporal framework, and explore the taxonomic implications in light of the updated phylogenetic framework. We used the plastome sequences from 158 accessions representing 139 taxa covering all 13 recognized genera of the tribe to reconstruct the Potentilleae phylogeny. High phylogenetic resolution was recovered along the Potentilleae backbone. Two major clades were recovered within Potentilleae, corresponding to the two subtribes Fragariinae and Potentillinae. Within Fragariinae, two subclades were recovered. In one subclade, Sibbaldia sensu stricto is sister to a clade containing Sibbaldianthe, Comarum, Farinopsis, and Alchemilla sensu lato. In the other subclade, Fragaria is sister to a clade comprising Chamaerhodos, Chamaecallis, Drymocallis, Dasiphora, and Potaninia. Within Potentillinae, Argentina is sister to Potentilla sensu stricto. Within Potentilla sensu stricto, clade Himalaya is sister to Alba, and the Himalaya-Alba clade together is sister to a clade comprising Reptans, Potentilla ancistrifolia Bunge, Fragarioides, Ivesioid, and Argentea. Divergence time estimates indicated that tribe Potentilleae originated during the middle Eocene, and subtribes Fragariinae and Potentillinae diverged around the Eocene-Oligocene transition, and divergence times dated for Potentilleae genera ranged from the early Miocene to the late Pleistocene.}
